      'hello world' is an app and desktop site hosted at https://www.helloworld.com/. The site is used for academic purposes only.
      It is for the UT Full Stack Bootcamp as a part of Challenge 22: MERN SPA. The following developers created the site:<br></br>
      - Ballard Ingram<br></br>
      - Cassandra Hardin<br></br>
      - Will Stock<br></br>
      - Stephen Fike<br></br>
      - Ramu Makkena<br></br>
      - Robert D. Gonzales
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
    The site being for academic purposes only does contain the ability for visitors to create an account, create content, and upload information.
    The ability to do this is assumed by all visitors to be voluntary and does not guarantee any outcome or meet any expectation of completion for a work product.
    By creating an account users agree to allow 'hello world' the ability to use, display, and store their information. This will include a display name, email address, password, and social media credentials if provided.
    Users are permitted to disable and delete their account by accessing the Account page.
    During this time, those functionalities may not result in account disablement or deletion and the visitor should note this before registering for 'hello world.'
    Additional steps will not be taken to comply with a CCPA, DCMA, or Opt Out request since this site is academic only and not for consumer use.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Users agree to a 'Code of Conduct' when using the site. All posts and user activity is monitored to ensure compliance with the 'Code of Conduct'.
      Users that violate the 'Code of Conduct' rules will be subject to account deletion.
      Users are not permitted to create another account using alternative communication methods to avoid this action.
      Users are not permitted to misrepresent themselves on the site.
      Users must be 18 years of age or older.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The 'Donation Center' is a non-functioning part of the academic site.
      It is not going to release funds or accept deposits.
